## Slide 2: The Problem
### "Why can't Gen Z invest easily?"
1.  **High Entry Barrier**: Blue-chip stocks like MRF (₹1.5L) or Page Industries (₹40k) are unaffordable for students/beginners.
2.  **Lack of Knowledge**: Financial literacy in India is low; most youth don't understand P/E, Market Cap, or Risk.
3.  **Regulatory Hurdles**: Minors (<18) cannot legally trade without complex guardian paperwork.
4.  **Fear of Loss**: Investing feels like gambling without proper guidance.

## Slide 3: The Solution - MicroShare
### "Fractional Investing + Education Ecosystem"
1.  **Fractional Ownership**: Own a piece of expensive stocks/ETFs with as little as ₹100. (e.g., Buy 0.001 MRF share).
2.  **Gamified Education**: "Learn & Earn" model. Complete quizzes -> Unlock trading limits -> Earn badges.
3.  **Guardian Oversight**: Minors invest under a "Simulated-Real" environment managed by parents until they turn 18.
4.  **Safe Playground**: Start with small amounts, learn the market moves, and build a portfolio risk-free.

## Slide 4: How It Works (Demo)
*Visual: Screenshots of App Flow*
1.  **Sign Up**: Minor creates profile, Guardian approves via KYC.
2.  **Learn**: User takes "Stock Basics" quiz to unlock the "Buy" button.
3.  **Invest**: User adds ₹500 to wallet -> Buys ₹500 worth of MRF.
4.  **Track**: Dashboard shows real-time growth (e.g., +₹50 profit).
5.  **Monitor**: Guardian receives alert for every transaction.
